# Car_Price_Prediction
# Problem Description
A model to predict the price of a used car should be developed in order to assess its value based on a variety of characteristics. Several factors affect the price of a used car, such as company, model, year, transmission, distance driven, fuel type, seller type, and owner type. As a result, We will find out the price of cars from this variable.
# Steps involved
Reading data from source and performing EDA
Performing feature engineering to feed desired data into ML model
Finding best set of hyper-parameters using Randomized Search CV to train the model
Evaluating various Regressor ML models using cross-validation and residual plot
